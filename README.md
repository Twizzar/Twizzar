Twizzar is a testing toolkit for .NET (C#) that helps you write high quality tests. Twizzar can automatically detect and generate dependencies of a class or interface. Thanks to its lean API and intuitive UI, which is seamlessly integrated in Visual Studio, it is easy to use and will speed up your work progress even in complex test setups. Twizzar will help you write clear and maintainable code tests, such as unit tests or integration tests.
